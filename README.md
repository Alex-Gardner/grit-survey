# grit-survey

Simple React survey app based on Duckworth's grit survey

TODO:
Submitting an answer to each question should move the user along to the next question in line

Each answer should have a point value associated with it: Odd questions (1, 3, 5 etc.) should have point values ranging from 1-5 (i.e. 'Very much like me': 1, while 'Not like me at all': 5). Even numbered questions should be the reverse ('Very much like me': 5).

The app should average the points for the quiz then display that average after the final question has been answered.
